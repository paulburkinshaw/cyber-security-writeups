# Exploiting HTTP Basic Authentication

**Platform**: TryHackMe  
**Category**: Brute Force  
**Technique**: HTTP Basic Auth brute force

---

## Objective

Brute force login credentials protected by HTTP Basic Authentication to gain access to a restricted resource.

---

## Background / Theory
In this exercise, we explore how attackers can exploit poor security practices surrounding HTTP Basic Authentication â€” specifically weak credentials and predictable usernames. HTTP Basic Auth itself is not inherently vulnerable, but when combined with a lack of brute-force protection and default or weak logins (e.g., admin:123456), it becomes a soft target. Using Burp Suite and a wordlist, we simulate a brute-force attack to reveal valid login credentials, highlighting the importance of strong authentication practices even in simple configurations.
This is a pure brute force attack targeting HTTP Basic Authentication using a known or assumed username (admin) and a list of common passwords. While the attack involves guessing credentials, it does not include an enumeration phase, as there is no attempt to discover or confirm valid usernames before launching the brute force.

## Steps

1. Go to Task 5 on https://tryhackme.com/room/enumerationbruteforce
2. Open the website and capture the Basic Auth request in Burp
3. Send the request to Intruder
4. Select the Authorization header value (the value after `Authorization: Basic`) and decode the base64 encoded value
5. Add the clear text value to Payloads
6. Configure the payload 
   1. Set the payload to Simple list
   2. Load the 500-worst-passwords.txt file
   3. In Payload processing add a prefix rule and enter `admin:` in the prefix field
   4. Add a second rule - rule type: `Encode`, Rule value: `Base64-encode`
   5. Remove the `=` value from the Payload encoding characters as it adds unesessary padding
   6. Click Start Atack button
   7. Select the request that has status code 200 and decode the base64 encoded string to reveal the password for the admin account

---

## Outcome

Successfully discovered login credentials for the `admin` user by brute-forcing HTTP Basic Authentication.

---

## Mitigation

- Use strong, unique passwords
- Avoid default usernames like `admin`
- Implement rate limiting or lockout mechanisms for repeated failed attempts
- Use more secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., token-based auth)
- Always use HTTPS to prevent interception of credentials in transit
